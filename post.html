          <h2>A story about macarons</h2>
          <div class="author"><em>by Simon</em></div>
          <p> You have probably already heard about the macarons. Made with almond powder, sugar, food coloring and egg white, these trendy cookies have become real stars among the pastries. Although the story says that this sweet is actually an Italian invention, it is a real French or to be more precise, a Parisian specialty. Today, it is almost impossible to visit Paris without tasting nicely colored, perfectly rounded and soft macrons. They are such a big deal in France that even the National Macaron Day was founded in 2005.

          <p> According to some stories, the macarons was created in 791 in an Italian monastery, and Catherine di Medici who married Henri II, the King of France, brought it in France in 1533. Since then, the macarons had a lot of success in France and especially at the court of Versailles. The macarons were made not only in Paris but also in many French cities, even if the amounts of the ingredients and the appearance varied from city to city, and from bakery to bakery. But, the original macaron was a little bit different from the pastry as we know it today. It consisted of only one biscuit and had no filling. The story of the Parisian macaron starts in the middle of the 19th century. The Maison Ladurée, a famous Parisian confectioner, made for the first time this pastry in the 1890s, and since then, they haven’t changed the recipe.
